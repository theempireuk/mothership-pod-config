Launch EC2
SSH in
Stop strapi
Docker system prune to remove container
Sed domain name in to init-letsencrypt and app.conf
Docker-compose nginx/certbot/strapi
Stop nginx/certbot
Run init-letsencrypt 

Only works when doing the above from host
Very close with running it from within mothership pod.
Getting error about not being to write to /etc/letsencrypt... when running init-letsencrypt.sh .
Think I need to volume mount more folders to mothership pod?
